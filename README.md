 Checkers Group Project 
 Frank Martino & Will Robb & Justin Chiller & Hien Vo

	Rather than just being a simple checkers game this, program contains 3 seperate games all playable, accesesd through one unifying menu;
	The three games that are playable in this program, are as follows: Checkers, Connect Four, and Tic Tac Toe;


	Credits:
	Tic Tac Toe was -- Will Robb
	Connect Four was -- Justin Chiller 
	The UI and menu was -- Hein Vo
	The Checkers game, and general code composition -- Frank Martino

	The tic Tac Toe game is played versus the computer, and as far as we can tell is unbeatable; 
	The Connect Four Game is solely two player;
	The Checkers game both has Single player(versus the computer) and two player;  

	All three game boards are displayed via Ascii charecters, and are played using a coordinate syste to refer to pieces on the board;

	The program only accepts integers as input

	The C code was compiled and run in visual studio 2013, and as such may not compile/run in ecclipse/codeblocks or a terminal and has not been tested to compile/run in those enviroments;

	Finally the system(cls) code used to clear the screen in between turns is only functional in Windows, not unix or on a mac;

	Included in the repo is a compiled executable, incase you wish to play against the ai and do not have visual studio to compile the code.
